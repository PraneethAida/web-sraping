# Web-Scraping
Scraping data from web using python library BeautifulSoup and requests.

# BeautifulSoup
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.  
It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.  
It commonly saves programmers hours or days of work.  

# Requests
Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor.   
Thereâ€™s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data.  
Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic.
